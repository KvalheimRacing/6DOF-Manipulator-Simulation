This folder contains:

- Documentation for kinematics and dynamics
- The files Forward_Inverse_Velocity_Kinematics_and_Dynamics and AI which is used to calculate the different parts of the kinematics and dynamics
- Matlabfunctions like Jacobian used to convert to C++ code
    - Here you can just open the function, and use MATLAB Coder to generate the same function in C++.
- Code generated by the matlab functions, C++ code for all nessecary functions.
